<h1>Python Asset Management Inserter</h1>
Interacts with the user to input asset data into the web portal using Python and Selenium. All data/log files are ignored, and the script is otherwise unable to be utilized outside of the intranet.

Later implementations:.
  - may utilize a concurrent thread driving PhantomJS to input assets as user data is collected
  - may allow arguments on execution that will parse a given csv file containing all necessary documentation
  - may bypass webportal if direct SQL DB connection can be made
